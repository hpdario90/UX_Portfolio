Here are a few examples of features I worked on for the Lily's garden game developed at Tactile.
What can be seen are preliminary research work, design documents including UX, interaction flows, mock-ups, wireframes.
The work here collected is just to give an idea of my skills, as I am allowed from my older employer to only share this and not more.
